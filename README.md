# Banana-Learning
## Abstract
Using various types of CNNs to distinguish between 4 kinds of Banana treatments qualities by observing the pictures only.</br>

## Project goals
- Use and combine data augmentation methods
- Give a possibility to distinguish between different banana plants that got different treatment
- Compare several convolutional neural networks architectures, inputs and types and result insights about them
- Find new methods and augmentation to exploit data

## Introduction
- Each code file stands for itself, meaning that you can run separately each piece of code
- The code can be divided into two categories: Data sorting and CNN's training
- There is a supplementary README inside the dirs

## Repository Dirs and Structure
- Examples: The code in this folder holds various code snippets and examples that I used to build my code
- report: holds the final report .Lyx file (in progress)
- source: in here you will find the experiments source code and the data sorting scripts I used

## Misc
- This code was written by Itamar Gozlan as part of a Final Project in the GIP lab at the Technion
- The project was advised by Alon Zvirin and Yaron Honen
